# pwsh-AD-import-users_from-CSV
Import into new or existing Domain AD users via CSV file

A Sample CSV is listed. Highly recommmend https://www.mockaroo.com/ if you're using it to generate dummy data. This code has not been stress tested, but does work with at least 2000 employees in my testing.

Put together from some existing code online, the logic has not changed, I've just added as many fields as I can to recreate a 'real environment'
